Question 1 - Architectural change that can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of 
the web application instance.
Currently the traffic hitting the web application instance is all from the public subnet. We can restrict this further
by allowing traffic only from the AppLoadBalancerSG security group.

Question 2
VPC private endpoints uses the private IP address of instance to access the resources needing security and so reduces 
exposures and attacks from the public internet and this will hence prevent the unauthorized access to the secret buckets

Question 3
No it doesnt, you have to manually apply default encryption to existing objects.

Question 4
if the original cloud formation templates applied to the environment then all the changes will be lost as all
settings revert back to the insecure state.
