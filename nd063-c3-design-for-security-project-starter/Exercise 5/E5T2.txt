Queston 1: Identify the tools that will allow us to: 
(a) scan infrastructure as code templates - regula (https://github.com/fugue/regula). THis is a multi-cloud infrastructure as code evaluation tool.
Regula can scan AWS CloudFormation templates, Terraform HCL code, Kubernetes manifests and Azure resource managers.
(b) Scan AMIs or containers for OS vulnerabilities - AWS GuardDuty
(c) Scan AWS cloud environment for config vulnerabilities - AWS Config 

Question 2:  Example of a compliance violation or vulnerability which each tool might expose
(a) Regula can find IAM policy violations, for example administrative priviledges
(b) AWS Guard Duty can identify root credential usage and brute force attacks
(c)  AWS Config basically scans for all known best practice violations from resources, like S3 bucket access and encryption to IAM roles and priviledges
