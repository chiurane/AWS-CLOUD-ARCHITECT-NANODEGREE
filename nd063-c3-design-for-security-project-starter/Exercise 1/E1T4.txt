Notable bad security practices identified include:
(1) Both the AttackInstance and the RecipeWebServiceInstance have been assigned 
the InstanceProfileRole so they have the same access to the recource in both buckets.
Therefore to restrict access different roles must be assigned to these instances.
(2) InstanceRole is defined such that it can performa any any actions on any 
of the S3 buckets which clearly doesnt obey the least priviledged access rule
(3) All the route tables point to 0.0.0.0/0 which means an attacker can transfer 
information anywhere once inside - we are not limiting the damage once an intruder is inside.
(4) All Security Groups including WebAppSG, AttackInstanceSG, AppLoadBalanceSG
have ingress and egress traffic rules configured. They should have different ingress and 
egress IP at the very least
(5) I would also introduce an AWS Client VPN Security Group for priviledged
business users accessing the secrete bucket
